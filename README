Hey! Haven't got time to write anything for now, so check out the blog post at http://www.josscrowcroft.com/2011/code/window-size-bookmarklet/ for details.

NB: to use this as a bookmarklet, make sure to stick "javascript:" (without quotes) in front of the minified code, then use that as the href/address of the bookmark.
