WindowSize Bookmarklet
----------------------

A handy bookmarklet that displays the dynamic viewport/screen size in pixels on any website - useful for inspecting and debugging CSS3 @media queries and responsive/adaptive layouts. 

Check out the blog post at http://www.josscrowcroft.com/2011/code/window-size-bookmarklet/ for details and a demo.

NB: to use this as a bookmarklet, make sure to stick "javascript:" (without quotes) in front of the minified code, then use that as the href/address of the bookmark.
